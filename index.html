	<h1>Doctor Deborah Brunt</h1>
	<p>We are at the beginning of a new era which will be marked by a greater fraternization between nations. The need to know and understand one another will be felt more and more. It follows that the study of foreign languages is assuming to-day a capital importance.</p>
	<p>All those who wish to make acquaintance with the speech of their neighbours, or who have allowed their former knowledge to grow rusty, will welcome this series of texts, which will enable them, independently of bulky dictionaries, to devote to language study the moments of leisure which offer themselves in the course of the day.</p>
